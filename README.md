# Hey there! 👋 I'm Bosh

**Solo full-stack creator turning ideas into working applications and products, fast.**

I'm a photographer and creative technologist with 10+ years of experience. I turned a passion for concert photography into a business, then taught myself web development through web3. I've built smart contracts, trained AI models, and produced AI-driven video for an AMC documentary series. After freelancing as a developer, I'm now working full time building software, separate from my creative projects.

## 🚀 Currently Looking For

**Backend, Frontend, and Full Stack roles** - Open to remote work and willing to relocate. Looking for at least $100,000 but open to other offers from the right company.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

After shipping dozens of solo projects, I'm eager to join a talented team where my rapid prototyping skills can level‑up larger, long‑term products. Keen to build in AI, Web3, and other frontier stacks that demand real‑time, high‑impact engineering.

## 🏆 Project I'm Most Proud Of

**Camera Person** - A Web3 project where I built a decentralized app that let people log in using their NFTs and submit photos to a community collection. We ended up with 122 different photographers from 39 countries! The photos became an NFT collection, and all proceeds went directly back to the artists equally through the blockchain. It connected strangers from places like Oman, Nigeria, Poland, and Brazil around something they cared about. [@camerapersonnft on X](https://twitter.com/camerapersonnft)
